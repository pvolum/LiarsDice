# liarsDice
iOS project 2015

Current Status:
Basic game flow, logic and graphics have been put into place. I've debugged a good bit but you may find something I have missed.<br>

Things that need to be implemented (there are commented TODO statments throughout the code):<br>
-'Exact' button logic needs to be implemented <br>
-Need to check for bad user input when entering a claim (valid input can be derived from the game instructions below)<br>
  -http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Play-Liar-Dice/step2/Rules/<br>
-need to handle end game condition and condition when a player runs out of dice and must be removed from the game<br>
-need to deactivate and reactivate buttons appropriatley<br>
  -You should not be able to doubt if you are making the first claim<br>
-the alert dialog box that asks for your quantity start as a regular keyboard, change it to start with the digits keyboard<br>
-add a button that links to the rules (link I posted above)<br>
<br>
Things that need to be ipmlmented beyond current features:<br>
-Create option for player vs computer (deisgn simple AI, this will be one of the heftier tasks but very interesting)<br>
-Add dice roll sound effects <br>
-Anything else you can think of  <br>
